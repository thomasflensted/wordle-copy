# Wordle Replicate

## Description
This is a replicate of the New York Times' game Wordle that I created to practice my programming skills. I built it using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. I haven't used any frameworks or libraries.

## Next Steps
* Rebuild with a database of words
* Make mobile friendly

## Issues
* Backspace does not work when clicking directly on the backspace icon inside the button
* One specific edge case is not handled properly by the word checking algorithm
